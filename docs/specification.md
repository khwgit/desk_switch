# DeskSwitch Application Specification

## Overview
A cross-platform KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) switch application built with Flutter that enables users to control multiple computers from a single set of peripherals. The application supports both client and server modes, with a focus on MacOS and Windows platforms initially, with plans for future desktop platform support.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter
- **State Management**: 
  - Hooks Riverpod for global state management
  - Flutter Hooks for widget-level state management
- **Navigation**: Go Router
- **Platform Support**: 
  - Primary: MacOS, Windows
  - Future: Linux, BSD

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Application Mode**
   - Client Mode
   - Server Mode
   - Mode Selection Interface

2. **Client Mode Features**
   - Server Connection Management
     - Manual IP input
     - Auto-detection of available servers
     - Connection status monitoring
   - Peripheral Control
     - Keyboard control
     - Mouse control
     - Display management
   - Connection Settings
     - Connection timeout
     - Reconnection attempts
     - Security settings

3. **Server Mode Features**
   - Network Configuration
     - IP address display
     - Port configuration
     - Network interface selection
   - Profile Management
     - Create/Edit/Delete profiles
     - Profile switching
     - Profile import/export
   - Client Management
     - Connected clients list
     - Client permissions
     - Connection monitoring

### State Management Structure
```dart
// Global State (Riverpod)
- ApplicationModeState
- ConnectionState
- ProfileState
- NetworkState
- SettingsState

// Widget State (Flutter Hooks)
- FormState
- AnimationState
- UIState
```

### Navigation Structure
```dart
// Routes
- / (Mode Selection)
- /client
  - /client/connect
  - /client/settings
- /server
  - /server/profiles
  - /server/network
  - /server/clients
```

## UI/UX Requirements

### Mode Selection Screen
- Clean, modern interface
- Clear visual distinction between client and server modes
- Smooth transitions between modes
- Platform-specific styling

### Client Mode Interface
- Server connection status indicator
- IP input form with validation
- Auto-detection results display
- Connection settings panel
- Quick disconnect option

### Server Mode Interface
- Current IP address display
- Profile management interface
  - List view of available profiles
  - Profile editor
  - Quick switch between profiles
- Network configuration panel
- Connected clients overview

## Data Models

### Profile
```dart
class Profile {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final Map<String, dynamic> settings;
  final DateTime lastModified;
  final bool isActive;
}
```

### Connection
```dart
class Connection {
  final String id;
  final String serverIp;
  final int port;
  final ConnectionStatus status;
  final DateTime connectedAt;
  final Map<String, dynamic> settings;
}
```

### NetworkConfig
```dart
class NetworkConfig {
  final String interface;
  final String ipAddress;
  final int port;
  final bool autoDetect;
  final List<String> allowedClients;
}
```

## Security Considerations
- Encrypted communication between client and server
- Authentication for server connections
- Secure profile storage
- Platform-specific security implementations

## Performance Requirements
- Low latency for peripheral control
- Efficient network usage
- Minimal CPU/memory footprint
- Smooth UI performance

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for core logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for client-server communication
- Platform-specific tests
- Performance benchmarks

## Future Considerations
- Support for additional desktop platforms
- Advanced profile features
- Custom peripheral mapping
- Multi-monitor support
- Remote file transfer
- Clipboard sharing

## Development Guidelines
1. Follow Flutter best practices
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Use proper logging
4. Maintain platform-specific code separation
5. Document all public APIs
6. Follow semantic versioning
7. Implement proper CI/CD pipeline

## Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hooks_riverpod: ^2.4.9
  flutter_hooks: ^0.20.3
  go_router: ^13.0.0
  # Additional dependencies to be added as needed
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Flutter SDK
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Configure platform-specific settings
5. Run the application

## Platform-Specific Implementation Notes

### MacOS
- Implement native keyboard/mouse control
- Handle permissions for input devices
- Network interface management
- Security considerations for system access

### Windows
- Implement native keyboard/mouse control
- Handle Windows-specific permissions
- Network interface management
- Security considerations for system access
